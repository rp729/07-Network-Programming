"""
Running things concurrently is known as multithreading
Running things in parallel is known as multiprocessing

I/O bound tasks - Waiting for input and output to be completed,
                    reading and writing from file system,
                    network operations
                    These all benefit more from threading
                    You get the illusion of running code at the same time,
                        however other code starts running while other code is waiting

cpu bound tasks - Good for number crunching
                    using CPU
                    data crunching
                    These benefit more from multiprocessing and running in parallel
                    Using multiprocessing might be slower if you have overhead from creating and
                    destroying files
