'''
1) Write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/json2.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read
the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the
sum of the numbers in the file and enter the sum below: Here are two files for this assignment. One is a sample file
where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_57128.json (Sum ends with 10)
You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL.

2) Scraping Numbers from HTML using python modules. In this assignment you will write a Python program similar to
http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllink2.py. The program will read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data,
extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file.

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other
is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.html (Sum=2553)

Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_57125.html (Sum ends with 54)

You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL.
