#### Lab 5

Write a TCP Server that will generate a random number from 0 to 100. Write TCP Client that will receive an input from the user \(number 0 to 100\) and send the guess to the server.  The server will then send back a message prompting the user to guess higher or lower.  If the user guesses the correct number, have the server send back a success message and when the client receives the success message it will break the connection.
