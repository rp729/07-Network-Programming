### Working With modules ( sys, os, subprocess, argparse, etc....) 

1. Write a script that runs a command (like "ls -l", it can be any command you choose). 

2. Write a script that runs a command and captures the number of bytes in a print statement.

3. Write a script that runs a command to display your current directory.

4. write a ping script where we get user input,and then run a ping request to that host.

5. Create a script that will accept a single integer as a positional argument, and will print a hash symbol that amount of times.
