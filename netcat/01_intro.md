## Common uses for Netcat
Netcat is a flexible and lightweight utility that can be used in a variety of scenarios. In this section, I will cover some of the more common uses and, in later sections, I will cover some of the more exotic uses.

Chat/Messaging Server: By using Netcat, an operator can redirect simple text between two computers in a simplistic chat or in an instant message interface.
File Transfers: Netcat allows you to transfer files between computers without the need to install a full-blown FTP server.
Banner Grabbing: Netcat allows an operator to establish a socket to a specific port to potentially identify the operating system, service, version, and other tidbits of information necessary to enumerate the purpose and/or potential weaknesses in the service.
Port Scanning: Netcat allows the operator to utilize a rudimentary port scanning function, whereby a port or series of ports can be interrogated to determine if the port is open or closed.
